EVE Online Market Tool (Python)


Description:


A margin trading tool for the video game EVE Online with a customizeable UI and sort/filter features. Cross referencing the queried item name with an item ID CSV file as a database, it queries the market API information for the corresponding item ID and returns it in a customizeable UI, saving the queried information as a CSV with timestamp of data for API call optimization. Utilizes Pandas, EVE Online's web API, and tkinter for the heavy lifting.
